In the book, `Selfish Gene`, the author talks about how we, humans, have evolved to use an even faster-evolving-genes called "*Ideas*".

*Ideas* essentially allow us to modify our behavior and shape our life and culture. Ideas have always helped us survive the environment, which would not have been possible with just our genes.

So, we can come to an "almost complete" conclusion that some ideas, no matter how unreasonable they may sound today, might have had been a good helping hand in the survivability of society back when it was prevalent.

Ideas like `astrology`, although currently proven to be unusable for accurate prediction of human behavior, might have been useful to a certain standard and widely accepted.

Perhaps the variables, the antiquated ideas were based on, have changed. It could have been due to the change in the physical world, or the change in the *`idea world`*. I am using this made-up term "`idea world`" to describe a world in which ideas affect each other - just like how `genes` affect each other in the grand scheme of the overall organism. It is just a hypothesis that a group of `ideas` will also influence the grand scheme of the overall culture of the society we live in.

If there was a way to accurately study these ideas of the past, which now have been deemed unusable, we can find out the factors resulted in its existence. Perhaps then, we might even find some factors that are still relevant and some that need to be improved upon; which would *modernize* these antiquated ideas and make them useful again. Or perhaps, those lost factors can now act as supporting pillars for existing ideas.

What I have spoken are just ramblings of my mind. If you find them nonsensical, pay no heed to it. But, if you find reason in this, please carry this idea with you. You might can find some closure for it and it won't be lost to time.
